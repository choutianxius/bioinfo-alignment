    "The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm finds the optimal **global** alignment of the two given sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "At many times, however, a local alignment is more desirable than a global one. Say, you are mapping a short sequence (no more than 100 letters) onto a large sequence (say 1000 letters). If there is an exact match of the short sequence in the longer sequence, it is better to find this exact match. However the global Needle-Wunsch algorithm is easily influenced by sub-sequences out of the exact matching region, so that a different alignment is often produced.\n",
